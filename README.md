# Eulerian grid-based 2D fluid simulator
This is a practice project for learning more about real-time simulations and implementation of computational solutions for differential equations, in this case a simplified version of the Navier-Stokes equations.
The visualization of the simulator is done using an OpenGL project i'd developed earlier.

## Here's a short demo.
